# Risk-Assessment-Report-2021

This is the group assignment which we conducted an risk assessment for our ISRM (information Security Risk Management) module in Y3S1. The main purpose of the risk assessment was to examine and discover flaws and vulnerabilities for different information technology assets belonging to Infotec institute to identify potential and already existing threats associated with the most critical assets and evaluate the risks according to the likelihood of impact and the financial impact on the organization. Furthermore, possible mitigation techniques and calculated cost estimations were represented at the end of the risk assessment to achieve the objectives and vision of the organization. These estimations and the procedures can then be examined by the relevant organization members to decide on a suitable course of action for the future.
